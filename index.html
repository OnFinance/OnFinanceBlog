									<h2>Journey of a Startup</h2>
									<p>From an idea to the stock markets
									</p>
								</header>
								
								<p class="py-20"><strong>
									It all begins with the idea, the vision, the plan. Can you pull it off? maybe! 
									You, with your friend, sit down to draw your first business plan.
									“Ladies and gentlemen tighten your seatbelts”, the journey begins!
								</strong></p>

							<p>
								You two decide to start a one of a kind t-shirt company, awesome!
								You do the research on the market, connect with some people to fill in the gaps in your business model
								 and your friend, the tech guy, develops your platform.
							</p>
								
							<p>Two months later, you have your platform ready, time to launch your product. 
							You are a hit! people are in love with your product. 
							To cope up with the demand you need to improve your platform and get some inventory.
							</p>

							<p><strong>Time to raise some cash.</strong></p>
							
							<p>
								When you guys started, you had decided to split up the 
								equity (stake in the company) to 50% each. After negotiating 
								the company’s valuation and other terms with the investor you end up with an 
								investment of 5Cr for post-money valuation(pre-money of 15Cr + 5Cr) of 20Cr.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							5Cr Rupees for a 20Cr valuation gives the investor a 25% stake in the company. Sad, right?
							Your each 50% stake got diluted to 37.5%, No! Your company which was basically worthless on paper now has a 
							great valuation with your stake alone being worth 7.5Cr that is if you sell the company immediately
							on the same valuation then you’ll take that sweet 7.5 Crores to your bank account. 
							But you decide not to, you still see a great potential in your company. 
							Time to get back to work.

							Congrats!Your prediction has come true and your company goes on to raise further rounds.
							Your investors are happy, you are happy but all those sky-touching valuations are just on paper.
							Time to exit! You can do it in two ways. Either sell it privately to another company or sell it 
							to the common retail investors who use your product and are eager to get a pie of your company’s
							business. You choose to go with the latter.
							</p>
							
							<br>
							<p>
								You offer your equity in an IPO and guess what? your stock is a hit! 
								After all those lonely days and overtime working hours you’ve finally made it.
								You cash in your stake after all the previous dilutions(but increased 
								valuations) and take a trip to the Bahamas! Tanning in the sun you get another 
								amazing idea! You call up your friend and there you go - <strong>You are off to start 
								another company and relive the journey all over again:)</strong>
