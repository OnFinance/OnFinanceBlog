									<h2>Game Development at BITS Goa</h2>
									<p>A good game gives us meaningful accomplishment - clear achievement that we donot necessarily get from real life

									While winter is taking its toll on the country, there are few whose spirit and passion fuel them to try to break the norm.
									So, the Mobile Applications Club of BITS Pilani, K.K. Birla Goa Campus has been trying to reinvent itself in a new light by
									going to previously dreaded territories.
								</p>

								<p>
									They have already put out three games from their production pipeline in a span of 60 days and by the time you are reading this blog, those games will be publically available. 
									And they also plan on a launch for a fourth game that the chose to keep a secret from us for now, but keep insisting will be ground-breaking for 
									the relatively dormant game development scene at BITS Goa.
								</p>
								<p>
									Anyways, here are the 3 games for you to checkout and review now:
									<figure class="figure">
											<img src="{{ "/images/gameLaunch.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" />
									</figure>
									<ul>
										<li><a href="https://macgamedev.itch.io/dogger">Dogger</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://macgamedev.itch.io/super-hexagon">Hexa</a></li>
										<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.macbitsgoa.tweetybird">Tweeety Bird</a></li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									We played through their games and felt that though the games were very addictive, they were neither very feature heavy nor 
									were they very emotionally immersing or involving.
								</p>

								<p>
									So, we thought to understand the developers' philosophy behind these games. We managed to get hold of Yatik and Garima who are game developers with MAC and according to our sources, pretty major contributor to developing the first and second games respectively
									and we asked them <strong>Why did they join game development? Why did they build that game and what does it do?</strong>
								</p>

								<p><strong>Yatik, Game Developer:</strong>
									Fascinated by the idea of developing a game on my own that will be played by thousands of people,
									I decided to join the GameDev Vertical of the MAC Club of our college.
									Dogger is an infinite runner style game, in which you have to survive avoiding obstacles 
									and your score is the time that you survived.The Game comprises of a player and 5 spawn points.
									At the begin of each wave,enemy blocks are spawned from 4 out of the 5 spawn points, the player has to pass through the 
									wave without colliding with any of the blocks in order to survive in the game.
									It is truly an addicting game and fits the bill on our "HyperCasual" theme perfectly.
								</p>

								<p><strong>Garima, Game Developer:</strong>
									I have always imagined to make some great games while playing the games on my phone, that silly dream was an underline factor of me opting CS as a child.
									And here it started from the first game of my life and many more to come.The people here have been very supportive and stood by us in every thick and thin and never really made me feel a stupid dreamer.
									The game, hexa, when I first got to know what we are going to make, it seemed almost impossible. The hexagons collapsing in from behind and the way it worked, it was hard to even think how will it be possible. But again with the help of seniors here, it became so easy!
								</p>


								<p>Then after much searching, we got to Priyesh. The person partly responsible for this messy affair.</p>

								<p><strong>When the name of the club very clearly states "Mobile Applications Club", why game development?</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Priyesh:</strong>
									I thought that the club had gotten stagnant and one-dimensional in its approach, so I thought it would be a nice thing to spice it up
									by bringing in variety. This is just one of the very few things that we are trying out in order to get more people into development by providing
									jucier alternatives than just stuffing 100+ people into the same niche, which frankly kills interest.
								</p>

								<p><strong>What advice would you give to a firstie getting into development? How do you convince yourself to keep pushing even after the fact the most of your apps/games(Tweeety Bird) have been uninspiring to say the least?</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Priyesh:</strong>
									Firstly, just keep pushing, for the first few months development is painstakingly hard and involves you trying out tens of platforms and run into a million errors.
									But get through that trial and you will be familiar with failure. 
									<br>
									I have just come to terms with the fact I am inherently a bad developer. But I also believe that you can only make a certain number of bad apps/games before you get
									that one masterpiece. So, you will have to tolerate me until then. 
									So you can pass some positive criticism about Tweeety Bird my way.
								</p>
								<p>
										On asking more questions we were diverted to the launch team.Luckily, we managed to get something from them as well. So enjoy reading.
								</p>
								
								<h3>Straight from the launch team</h3>
								<p>A good game can only come up when you have a great team and Tanmay has some of the best by his side. So we thought we would get in some answers from them.</p>
								
								<p><strong>What were your expectations from them(Game Development Mentors)? How has the overall experience been?</strong></p>
								
								<p><strong>Anshuman, Game Developer:</strong> Overall, it has been a very great and educating experience for me joining the game development vertical of MAC in my first year itself.
								The mentors have always been available for us. Initially it was tough balancing both academics and coding but man has it been worth the effort.</p>

								<p><strong>Wahib, Game Developer:</strong> I feel that when you are in your first year, you need to be able to get your hands as dirty as possible and explore as many things as you have available to you
								because it will allow you to truly understand yourself. I strongly encourage all my batch mates to approach the seniors and getting going quickly</p>

								<p><strong>How do you keep your team involved, even when they fail repeatedly?</strong></p>

								<p><strong>Tanmay, MAC Co-ordinator:</strong>Firstly, it is very important to make them understand that even though they are well underway they are not the experts yet.
									I always tell them one thing, take this tip from nature: "The woods would be a very silent place if no birds sang except those who sang best". 
									So use all that talent you got and remember if someone can make it happen, its you.</p>

								<p><strong>What does the future hold for game development?</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Tanmay, MAC Co-ordinator:</strong>I am not the one to give out any spoilers but I can sense that we are onto something amazing here,
									there is certainly some potential in the team that we have assembled here. All I can say is version 2 of these games will be out soon after we have finished analyzing the feedback.
								</p>

								<p><strong>What are your thoughts regarding the club's new verticals and the progress in the game development branch?</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Vikramaditya,Former MAC Co-ordinator:</strong>It's a promising sign, the nature of tech is to evolve, progress and 
									improve. MAC also needs to keep up with the changing times and diversify accordingly. Our goal should be to make software development 
									easily accessible and fun to learn, this must be paramount to the decisions that MAC takes. 
									The verticals approach will not only give members of MAC a chance to explore but also enhance skills in various tech avenues.
