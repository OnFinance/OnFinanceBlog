The way they have bought their comic characters to real life on screen is nothing short of a cultural phenomenon.It is safe to say that Marvel has defined this past decade.How can anyone forget the climax of "Avenger when in the 
heart-touching moment when Tony stark's life gets saved, he asks for a shawarma in his uber-cool way, just legendary!It's hard to imagine that such a legendary studio, once had to go through bankruptcy.Yes! Marvel was a bankrupt company once.
Like every great superhero,Marvel too had to don it's superhero abilities to reach the position it's in today.

It was December 26th 1996, Marvel's owner Ronald perelman filed for it's bankruptcy.Back in 1989 when he bought marvel this wasn't the case.With his sale tactics he increased the production of comic books which saw unprecedented success also helped by a comic speculator boom in the 90's.This led to their debut in the stock market by July 15th, 1991.But it had a bad time when this boom got burst in '93.It's sales dropped by 70% and within 3 years it lost  93% of it's market cap and had $610 Million in debt.Pelerman saw the company's future in movies, but the shareholder's opposed this plan which led him to file for bankruptcy so as to take control over the decisions made.They started auctioning the cinematic rights of their characters to different production houses,but the problem was they did'nt have the leverage and as a result were forced to underwhelming agreements.This struck back hard because they earned meagre profits through these deals.Take the first two spiderman movies for example which grossed a staggering $3 Billion but marvel just made a profit of around $60 Million.

Then came David Maisel with the audacious idea of marvel making their own movies.They recieved $525 Milion from Meryll Lynch with it's 10 important characters as a collateral.This was a huge gamble.With this money they bought characters which they have previously sold which included the likes of Iron Man and Hulk and also hired Kevin Fiegel as their president. Their first franchise movie Iron-man was released on May 2 ,2008 and was an instant blockbuster both critically and financially.One year later Disney bought Marvel for a whoppinig $4.2 Billion.Now this is nothing short of a superhero story and for a company 20 years ago that was on the brink of collapse, survived it's worst phases and turned around to be the most profitablefranchise in history. Disney acquiring 21st century fox with characters like deadpool and X-men makes this story more interesting.Don't be surprised if you see these characters in a fusion of the comic universe pretty soon!
