It is safe to say that Marvel Studios has defined film-making in this past decade.
How can anyone forget the climax of "The Avengers", the heart-touching moment when Tony Stark's is saved and he expresses his desire to have a shawarma, just legendary! 
</p>
<p>
It's hard to imagine that such a legendary studio, once had to go through bankruptcy.Yes! Marvel was a bankrupt company once.
Like every great superhero,Marvel too had to don it's superhero abilities to reach the position it's in today.

On the 26th of December 1996, Marvel filed for bankruptcy.Back in 1989, when Robert Perelman bought Marvel, this wasn't the case.With his sales tactics he increased the production of comic books which saw unprecedented success also helped by a comic speculator boom in the 90's.This led to their debut in the stock market by July 15th, 1991.
</p>

<strong>
When the Comic Boom bubble burst in '93. Marvel's sales dropped by 70% and within 3 years they had lost 93% of their financial value and were $610 Million in debt.</strong>

<p> Pelerman saw the company's future in movies, but the shareholders opposed this plan which led him to file for bankruptcy in order to take control over the decisions made. They started auctioning the cinematic rights of their characters to different production houses. For example they sold rights to the X-men and their then most hit team Fantastic Four to 21st Century Fox. Similarly they sold spiderman and venom and so on to Sony Entertainment. But the problem was that they didn't have any leverage and were forced to accept underwhelming deals. </p>
<p>
This struck back hard because they earned meagre profits through these deals.Take the first two spiderman movies for example which grossed a staggering <strong>$3 Billion</strong> but Marvel only pocketed around <strong>$60 Million.</strong>

<strong>Maisel magic</strong>
</p>
<p>
In 2003, Maisel pitched Marvel Studios’ CEO and Chairman, Avi Arad and then pitched CEO, Isaac Perlmutter, on his idea of Marvel financing and producing its own movies in a connected cinematic universe. Perlmutter hired Maisel as Marvel Studios’ President. To execute his plan, Maisel engineered a slate-structure financing to total $525 million. They recieved this amount from Meryll Lynch by collateralizing their 10 most important characters.
</p>
<p>
This was a huge gamble. But the money alloweed them to buy back some of their characters such as Iron Man and The Hulk.
</p>
<p>
Marvel Studios released their first franchise movie "Iron Man" on the 2nd of May 2008 and it was an instant blockbuster, both critically acclaimed and financially successful. Then on, Marvel Studios have gone from strength to strength making multi- billion dollar hits like "Black Panther"(<strong>$ 1.4B</strong>) and "Avengers:Infinity War"(<strong>$ 3.1B</strong>)
</p>
<strong>Current Scenario</strong>
<p>
One year after the first Iron Man movie, Disney acquired Marvel for a whopping $4.2 Billion, which seems nothing short of a superhero story and for a company 20 years ago that was on the brink of collapse. Overall , Marvel has survived it's worst phases and turned around to be the most profitable franchise in history of film making. With Disney's recent acquisition of 21st Century Fox the story has become more interesting.

<strong>A new mega merger between the X-men and the Avengers to create a unified cinematic universe should not surprise us</strong>
