excerpt: "Diversity is pretty important. A generalist is more valuable than a specialist. A specialist isn’t fluid enough. We look for pretty broad skills and data passion. If you are passionate about it you’ll jump into whatever tool you need to. If it’s in X, I’ll go jump in X."

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured.  

## Overview

In simple terms, data science is the uncanny combination of statistics and computer science. It exhibits itself in all facets of life, some of which will even surprise you.It is best illustrated by the following example:  
If you happen to ask someone,__"How did you choose your current career path?"__
Most people will give you a response that can be condensed into the following figure.

"How is this data science?", I hear you ask. Well, allow me to explain. In each of your steps, you take in some raw information from the internet or elsewhere. Then you compile it and analyze it using various tools (mostly excel and your brain) with the aim of derive some information from it. Then you either store this information or carry it forward to the next step of the decision making process.  
__This is exactly what data scientists do.__  

### Rise of Modern Data Science

If the data analyst in you demands the 'Why'? Well, here are 6 broad reasons for you to save your time:

* __The ‘Big Data’ became open:__ Big data usually includes data sets with sizes beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to process within a tolerable elapsed time. These large datasets which complex Deep Learning algorithms require became freely available.__Therefore models got more complex and result became better.__
* __Right tools:__ With availability of robust tools like NoSQL databases and distributed computing, the general approach has become to throw everything in your NoSQL cluster and we may or may not use it to analyze some statistics.
* __The ‘Deep Learning’ boom:__ Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Deep learning architectures such as mainly neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and so on.
* __Cloud computing__ You can just rent a couple hundred machine instances from any cloud service provider for an hour, do the analysis. Kill the servers. Your job is done in 10 to 100 dollars.
* __GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) based processing__ The development of CUDA toolkit by Nvidia makes computing much faster by leveraging the parallel processing power of GPUs to basically perform CPU operations.
* __It Works:__ You will find many companies used analytics to increase revenue, improve user base, increase user engagement, innovated an existing process or simply raked dollars by providing big data analytics as service.

### Data Science Methodology

In this manner, it is very critical to understand what is the data science methodology or 'pipeline'. According to my analysis, every successfull data scientist follows these six steps to make a successfull data-based application:

* __Understanding and Sourcing the data__
* __Preparing/Preprocessing the data__
* __Transformation of the data__
* __Choosing Suitable Model(s)__
* __Evaulating the Model__
* __Deploying the Model__

I will not go into further details here as each individually is a very vast topic and will be subject of future blogs.
