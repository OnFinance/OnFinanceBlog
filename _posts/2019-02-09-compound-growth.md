Let's start with a question. "What is the one habit that is common in all rich people? <strong>They invest</strong>. It's as simple as that. So what is it about investing that attracts these guys so much? <strong>Compounding</strong>.The great Albert Einstein once said <strong>“compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it."</strong> When someone of that stature says that it must be of some importance.

<div class="caption" style="font-size:small">The graph shows your net worth if you keep adding Rs.50k annually at 20% of returns.
<p>
By year 20 your net worth would reach a staggering 1 crore and by year 30 it would be a staggering 7 crore. That's a 7 times increase in last 10 years of your investment

<p>So what is the power compounding? In layman terms this is called the "snowball effect". This is because an avalanche, before becoming a force so large, just starts with a small snowball with regular addition of snow. This is exactly what compounding is! You just need to set aside a fixed amount for every period, add it to your investment and watch as the magic of money happens.</p>

But compounding requires <strong>
discipline</strong>,<strong>
patience</strong> and most importantly <strong>
Time</strong>.Let's end this article with a quote on compounding from one of the greatest inventors, Sir Benjamin Franklin <strong>"EVERY PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED".</strong>
