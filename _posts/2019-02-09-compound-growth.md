Let's start with a question. "What is the one habit that is found common in all the rich? **They invest**. It's as simple as that. So what is about investing that attracts these guys so much?"Compounding".The great Albert Einstein once said “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it … he who doesn’t … pays it."When someone of that stature says that it must be of some importance.

<small>The graph shows your net worth if you keep adding Rs.50k annually at 20% of returns.
By year 20 your net worth would reach a staggering 1 crore and by year 30 it would be a staggering 7 crore. That's a 7 times increase in last 10 years of your investment</small>

<p>So what is the power compounding? In layman terms this is called the "snowball effect".This is because an avalanche, before becoming a force so large, just starts with a small snowball with regular addition of snow. This is exactly what compounding is! You just need to set aside a fixed amount for every period, add it to your investment and watch as the magic of money happens.</p>

<small>Warren Buffet understood this pretty well early in his life and started investing at the age of 13. Majority of his wealth got accumulated after the age of 50*</small>

But compounding requires <strong>
discipline</strong>,<strong>
patience</strong> and most importantly <strong>
Time</strong>.Let's end this article with a quote on compounding from one of the greatest inventors,Sir Benjamin Franklin <strong>"EVERY PENNY SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED".</strong>
